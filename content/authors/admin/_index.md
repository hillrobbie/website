I am a PhD candidate at the Nova School of Business and Economics. I work in the field of applied econometrics with interests in Bayesian dimension reduction, state-space models, and time-varying parameter models. 

Econometrics and working with data are my main interests, although you can sometimes have too much of a good thing! When I need a break I enjoy coastal rowing, acting in amateur theatre and listening to history podcasts.
