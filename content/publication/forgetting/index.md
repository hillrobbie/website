abstract: "There is widespread evidence of parameter instability in the literature. One way to account for this 
feature is through the use of time-varying parameter (TVP) models that discount older data in favour of more recent data.
This practise is often known as forgetting and can be applied in several different ways. This paper introduces and examines 
the performance of different  (flexible) forgetting methodologies in the context of the Kalman filter. We review and develop 
the theoretical background and investigate the performance of each methodology in simulations as well as in two empirical forecast 
exercises using dynamic model averaging (DMA). Specifically, out-of-sample DMA forecasts of CPI inflation and SP500 returns obtained using 
different forgetting approaches are compared. Results show that basing the amount of forgetting on the forecast error does not perform as well 
as avoiding instability by placing bounds on the parameter covariance matrix (JEL classification: C22, C51, C53).
